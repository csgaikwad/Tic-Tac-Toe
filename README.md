# Tic Tac Toe Games

This repository contains two implementations of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using the MERN stack. One implementation uses React hooks for state management, while the other utilizes Recoil for state management. Both implementations also include user authentication functionality.

## üöÄ Features

Both implementations of the Tic Tac Toe game include the following features:

- Two-player gameplay: Play against a friend or family member in real-time.
- User authentication: Sign up, log in, and log out securely to access the game.
- Real-time updates: See changes to the game board and player turns in real-time using WebSocket connections.
- Responsive design: Play the game on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-games.git
```

### Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd tic-tac-toe-games
```

### Install dependencies for both the client and server:
```bash
cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
```

### Set up environment variables:
- Create a .env file in the server directory.
- Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret) to the .env file.

### Install dependencies for the frontend:
```bash
npx create-react-app client
```
### Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd client
```
### Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```
### Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Tic Tac Toe game.

This provides the correct steps for setting up the frontend using Create React App within the client directory. Let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!
